* 1.0.0 (July 13 2007)
	* First public release (version 1.0.0)

* 1.0.1 (July 14 2007)
    * fixed some bugs
    * added a compatibility option (in the preferences) to disable Unicode characters which can cause problems on some systems (namely Windows...)
    * added options to enable or disable displaying of types in the outline, editor popups, and editor's status bar.
    * modified the install to unpack the plug-in's jar after installation, because Windows couldn't find some image resources in the jar file (although this worked on other systems)
    * changed the generated "makefile" file in Makefile Projects to "Makefile" (capitalized) 
    
* 1.0.2 (July 21 2007)
    * Plug-in is compiled with Java 1.5 compatibility options again (I forgot it in 1.0.1, sorry!). This should fix "Bad version number in .class file" errors.
    * Toplevel process now inherits parent environment
    * Fixed a bug in "Load in Toplevel" action under Windows 
    
* 1.0.3 (July 22 2007)
    * This update fixes (hopefully!) the Java 1.5 compatibility problems. The previous version still wasn't compatible with Java 1.5 due to a bug (feature?) in the Eclipse plug-in build system: the plug-in was always built using the general settings instead of the project-specific ones.
    * The plug-in is no longer unpacked on install, since the bug which prevented loading of icons from the jar on Windows has been fixed. 

* 1.0.4 (July 23 2007)
	* Fixed a bug with hyperlinks that happened when a definition had the same name as one in Pervasives
	* Completion proposals can now look in linked resources (patch submitted by Gregory)
	* Syntax coloring now works correctly with comments inside strings inside comments and ocamldoc comments (strings must be terminated inside comments in Ocaml)
	* "unexpected end of line" syntax error now appears at the end of the file instead of the beginning
	* changed the formatter so that it doesn't add a space before a colon, since that can cause naming labels to become incorrect ("~a:1" became "~a : 1")
	* added a preference page for the formatter
	* added a preference page for filtering the contents of the outline
	* added a preference page for the debugger 
	* updated OcamlMakefile (generic makefile) to the latest version
	* added "/bin" (on a Unix system, if it exists) and the Ocaml library path to the makefile paths of a new makefile project
	* fixed a bug that caused the whole interface to freeze while the outline was being rebuilt
	
* 1.0.5 (July 24 2007)
	* fixed a bug that caused the debugger to get stuck when the executable being debugged was killed
	* completion box now automatically closes after typing a space
	* added a facility to change all the paths at once in the paths preference page
	* added an option to always expand some elements in the outline (modules, classes)
	* added an option (both in the preferences and in the outline toolbar) to always fully expand the outline
	* fixed a bug in the parser with complex patterns in 'let in' expressions
	* added editing support for ml4 files (but no parser and no outline)    
	
* 1.0.6 (July 25 2007)
	* hyperlinks now find renamed modules in current module
	* hyperlinks now work correctly with definitions like: "let a = 2;; let a = a in let a = a in a;;" 
	* modified the paths preference page to make it more intuitive
	* added an option to "unnest" "let in" definitions (activated by default)
	* added "while" and "begin end" templates 
	* improved outline speed
	
* 1.0.7 (July 27 2007)
	* Completion, hyperlinks, and the module browser are now based on the new parser (major refactoring)
	* Drastic speed-up of hyperlinks which open other modules
	* Tweaked the 'unnest in' option, and corrected a bug which caused definitions to appear out of order.
	* Split the outline preference page into two pages, because it was too long.
	* Fixed a bug with definitions that appeared several times in the outline when the code was not syntactically correct.
	* Fixed a bug with syntax coloring of ocamldoc comments
	* If the debugger doesn't want to exit after clicking on "terminate", a second click on the "terminate" button will kill it, together with the debugged process
	* Added an option (for the editor) to automatically add the closing double-quote
	* "Convert revised syntax to standard syntax" and "Format with camlp4" actions now display the potential error message
	* Definitions cache now uses soft references
	* Added an option to not display 'and' definitions in blue in the outline
	
* 1.0.8 (July 29 2007)
	* Now, completion gives elements found in other modules even if there is no associated mli
	* Corrected a rare bug with syntax-coloring of ocamldoc comments
	* Now, a different (red) icon appears in completion results for modules that couldn't be parsed
	* Changed the 'let in' icon in the outline: now, the (+) icon only appears when the definition is at toplevel
	* The integrated lexer now supports linenum directives
	* Added an outline for ocamlyacc files (showing non-terminals) 
	* Fixed a bug with non-rec definitions that would act as rec in hyperlinks
	* Corrected some bugs with the 'unnest let in definitions' option in outline
	
* 1.1.0 (Aug 02 2007)
	* Added support for ocamlbuild projects (reset the O'Caml perspective to get the project shortcut)
	* Type annotations are searched first in ml folder, then in _build + ml folder 
	* Big change in Ocaml Browser: now you can add new locations (right-click on tree), and the loading and parsing is done lazily (when you expand a node)
	* Fixed yet another bug with hyperlinks  
	* Fixed a bug in the lexer (with line labels)   
	* Fixed another bug in the lexer with the '"' character inside comments    
	* Added separate color preferences for 'let','in' and 'fun','function' keywords
	* Added optional syntax coloring of punctuation 
	* Corrected a bug in the paths preference page on Windows
	* Added '*.obj' and '_build' in the list of navigator filters 
	* Hid some resources from versioning system (*.cmo, *.annot, ...). If you ever need to commit these resources, see "Window > Preferences > Team > Ignored Resources".   
	 
* 1.1.1 (August 21 2007) 
	* New menu action for opening the currently opened file counterpart (interface/implementation)
	* Support for camlp4 preprocessing 	
	
* 1.2.0 (April 20 2008)
	* Code formatter rewrite : better formatting and more parameters
	* Replaced build "N°" by corresponding Unicode character (as suggested by Ben Liblit)
	* Removed unnecessary protection tokenization of ocamlbuild paths, which caused problems
	* Use parsed ml files in completion when there is no corresponding mli file
	* Removed the underscore from colorized punctuation characters
	* User setting for disabling automatic completion
	* Changed a regular expression which was causing stack overflows on big inputs
	* Interface files are now parsed with a real parser, instead of the old fuzzy one
	* Can now create custom toplevels (Run As > Ocaml Toplevel)
	* In the toplevel, Ctrl+Enter always evaluates the expression, even when it is not terminated with ";;". This is useful to answer input queries, or when using a different syntax (revised syntax uses a single ";" for example).
	* Changed the terminal type for toplevel, so that it doesn't try to send formatting characters  
	* The debugger is now passed the paths defined for the project 
	* Commenting and uncommenting of code blocks in the editor (protected and not protected)

	* Option to override ocamlbuild tools paths
	* When a folder is added or removed in an ocaml project, this project's paths are automatically changed accordingly
	* Ctrl+Clicking on "B" in "module A = B" now opens B.mli or B.ml
	* Simplified synchronization in Ocamlbuild builder and makefile builder
	* Replaced linked external resources by uses of the new Eclipse File System API to open workspace-external files in editors. This means no more ".DebuggerSourceLookup" and ".HyperlinksLinkedFiles", which should also fix incompatibility with eclipsedarcs.
	* Opening a module's/interface's counterpart now works on external resources
	* Fixed a layout issue in project paths properties page
	* Improved O'Caml paths preference page
	* Removed a check that prevented using the Cygwin version of ocamldebug on Windows

	* Preference initializer now sets default ocamldebug path on Windows (O'Caml 3.11)
	* Checkpoints are disabled by default on Windows since they are not supported by ocamldebug on Windows

1.2.5
	* Fixed a problem with definition offsets, which caused some files to be unavailable for code help (see <a href="http://ocaml.eclipse.free.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=213&start=0">this forum post<a/>)
