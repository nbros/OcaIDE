    <h2>History:</h2>

    This project was developed by Nicolas Bros and Rafael Cerioli in 2006-2007, as a
    semester project in a Master of Computer Science at
    the <a href="http://www.upmc.fr/">University of Paris VI: Pierre et Marie Curie</a>,
    and it was supervised by Emmanuel Chailloux. It was then continued by Nicolas Bros
    as a summer job for five weeks. This project is inspired by previous attempts
    of the same kind before 2006 (by Guillaume Curat, Leonard Dallot, Alexandre Deckner,
    Nicolas Deckner, Sylvain Le Ligné, Alexandre Serra and Guillaume Viel).
