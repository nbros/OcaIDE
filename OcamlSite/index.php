        <li> Automatic indentation while typing in the editor (configurable in the preferences)
        <li> A customizable integrated code formatter, and an interface to the camlp4 formatter (through an AST printer)
        <li> Completion
        <li> Library browser, both for the standard library and user libraries
        <li> Integrated debugger (a graphical interface to the OCaml text-mode debugger), with remote debugging support and script file support

    <h2>History:</h2>

    This project was developed by Nicolas Bros and Rafael Cerioli in 2006-2007, as a
    semester project in a Master of Computer Science at
    the <a href="http://www.upmc.fr/">University of Paris VI: Pierre et Marie Curie</a>,
    and it was supervised by Emmanuel Chailloux. It was then continued by Nicolas Bros
    as a summer job for five weeks. This project is inspired by previous attempts
    of the same kind before 2006 (by Guillaume Curat, Leonard Dallot, Alexandre Deckner,
    Nicolas Deckner, Sylvain Le Lign√©, Alexandre Serra and Guillaume Viel).
