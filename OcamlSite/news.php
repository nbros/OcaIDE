    web interface: <a href="http://github.com/nbros/OcaIDE">http://github.com/nbros/OcaIDE</a> <br>
    Contributors are welcome!

            href="http://ocaml.eclipse.free.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=213&start=0">this forum post</a>)
        <li> Fixed a problem when an empty path was passed to ocamlbuild
        <li> Extracted help into a different plug-in to avoid forcing users to download the whole documentation each
            time an update is done, since the help isn't updated nearly as often as the binaries.
    </ul>

<li><b>January 11 2009:</b> Version 1.2.4
    <ul type="circle">
        <li> Toplevel now uses Eclipse text font (which can be changed in preferences)

            href="http://ocaml.eclipse.free.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=94&start=0">this forum post</a>)
        <li> Preference initializer now sets default ocamldebug path on Windows (OCaml 3.11)
        <li> Checkpoints are disabled by default on Windows since they are not supported by ocamldebug on Windows

<li><b>July 20 2008:</b> Version 1.2.2
    <ul type="circle">

        <li> Can separate run file and debugged file (patch from forum member khooyp)
        <li> Redirected messages to the console and handled uncaught exceptions (patch from forum member khooyp)

    <ul type="circle">
        <li> Remote debugging support, patch submitted by Jonathan Knowles
        <li> Updated documentation for debugging under Windows and remote debugging
    </ul>

<li><b>April 20 2008:</b> Version 1.2.0
    <ul type="circle">
        <li> Code formatter rewrite : better formatting and more parameters
        <li> Integrated a patch for OMake support contributed by Dmitry Bely
        <li> Interface files are now parsed with a real parser, instead of the old fuzzy one
        <li> Use parsed ml files in completion when there is no corresponding mli file
        <li> Replaced linked external resources by uses of the new Eclipse File System API to open workspace-external
            files in editors. This means no more ".DebuggerSourceLookup" and ".HyperlinksLinkedFiles", which should also
            fix incompatibility with eclipsedarcs.
        <li> Can now create custom toplevels (Run As > Ocaml Toplevel)
        <li> Commenting and uncommenting of code blocks in the editor (protected and not protected)
        <li> Replaced Unix newlines by platform newlines
        <li> Added 'insert spaces instead of tabulations' option for the OCaml editor
        <li> Hyperlink on open directive opens a ".ml" file when there is no ".mli" file
        <li> Added conversion from tabs to spaces

            accordingly
        <li> Option to override ocamlbuild tools paths
        <li> Improved OCaml paths preference page
        <li> Replaced build "N°" by corresponding Unicode character (as suggested by Ben Liblit)
        <li> Removed unnecessary protection tokenization of ocamlbuild paths, which caused problems
        <li> Removed the underscore from colorized punctuation characters
        <li> User setting for disabling automatic completion
        <li> Changed a regular expression which was causing stack overflows on big inputs
        <li> In the toplevel, Ctrl+Enter always evaluates the expression, even when it is not terminated with ";;". This
            is useful to answer input queries, or when using a different syntax (revised syntax uses a single ";" for
            example).
        <li> Changed the terminal type for toplevel, so that it doesn't try to send formatting characters
        <li> The debugger is now passed the paths defined for the project
        <li> Optimized an often used function
        <li> Keep leading and trailing newlines as-is when formatting a selection

        <li> Type annotations are searched first in ml folder, then in _build + ml folder
        <li> Big change in Ocaml Browser: now you can add new locations (right-click on tree), and the loading and
            parsing is done lazily (when you expand a node)
        <li> Fixed yet another bug with hyperlinks
        <li> Fixed a bug in the lexer (with line labels)

        <li> Tweaked the 'unnest in' option, and corrected a bug which caused definitions to appear out of order.
        <li> Split the outline preference page into two pages, because it was too long.
        <li> Fixed a bug with definitions that appeared several times in the outline when the code was not syntactically
            correct.
        <li> Fixed a bug with syntax coloring of ocamldoc comments
        <li> If the debugger doesn't want to exit after clicking on "terminate", a second click on the "terminate"
            button will kill it, together with the debugged process
        <li> Added an option (for the editor) to automatically add the closing double-quote
        <li> "Convert revised syntax to standard syntax" and "Format with camlp4" actions now display the potential

        <li> Completion proposals can now look in linked resources (patch submitted by Gregory)
        <li> Syntax coloring now works correctly with comments inside strings inside comments and ocamldoc comments

        <li> "unexpected end of line" syntax error now appears at the end of the file instead of the beginning
        <li> changed the formatter so that it doesn't add a space before a colon, since that can cause naming labels to

    </ul>

<li><b>July 22 2007:</b> Update 1.0.3
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>This update fixes (hopefully!) the Java 1.5 compatibility problems.
            The previous version still wasn't compatible with Java 1.5 due to
            a bug (feature?) in the Eclipse plug-in build system: the plug-in was always
            built using the general settings instead of the project-specific ones.
        <li>The plug-in is no longer unpacked on install, since the bug which prevented
            loading of icons from the jar on Windows has been fixed.
    </ul>

        <li>Plug-in is compiled with Java 1.5 compatibility options again (I forgot it in 1.0.1, sorry!).
            This should fix "Bad version number in .class file" errors.

        <li>Fixed a bug in "Load in Toplevel" action under Windows
    </ul>
<li><b>July 14 2007:</b> I will be in holidays from July 15 to July 21

<li>
    <b>July 14 2007:</b> Update (1.0.1):
    (see the <a href="install.php">install</a> page for information on how to update)
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>fixed some bugs
        <li>added a compatibility option
            (in the preferences) to disable Unicode characters which can cause problems on some
            systems (namely Windows...)
        <li>added options to enable or disable displaying of types in the outline, editor popups, and
            editor's status bar.
        <li>modified the install to unpack the plug-in's jar after installation, because Windows
            couldn't find some image resources in the jar file (although this worked on other systems)
        <li>changed the generated "makefile" file in Makefile Projects to "Makefile" (capitalized)
    </ul>
</li>
